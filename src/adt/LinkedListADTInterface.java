 * This interface will serve as the ADT for the LinkedList.
 * This ADT will define the operations available on the LinkedList.
 * As all the other Data Structures, the LinkedList will have operations to:
 * 1. add a node in the linked list.
 * 2. delete a node from the linked list.
 * 3. search a node in the linked list.
 * 4. sort the whole linked list based on the type of data its nodes contain.
 * 5. traverse the whole linked list and print the contents of its nodes.
